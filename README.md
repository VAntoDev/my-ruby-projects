My Ruby projects, from The Odin Project 

<h3>Caesar Cipher:</h3>
Implement a #caesar_cipher method that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string.

<h3>Substrings:</h3>
Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

<h3>Stock Prices:</h3>
Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.
